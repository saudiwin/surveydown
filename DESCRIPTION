Description: Generate surveys using markdown and R code chunks. Surveys are composed of two files: a survey.qmd 'Quarto' file defining the survey content (pages, questions, etc), and an app.R file defining a 'shiny' app with global settings (libraries, database configuration, etc.) and server configuration options (e.g., conditional skipping / display, etc.). Survey data collected from respondents is stored in a 'PostgreSQL' database. Features include controls for conditional skip logic (skip to a page based on an answer to a question), conditional display logic (display a question based on an answer to a question), a customizable progress bar, and a wide variety of question types, including multiple choice (single choice and multiple choices), select, text, numeric, multiple choice buttons, text area, and dates. Because the surveys render into a 'shiny' app, designers can also leverage the reactive capabilities of 'shiny' to create dynamic and interactive surveys.

\title{Define skip conditions for survey pages (Deprecated)}
\usage{
sd_skip_if(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more formulas defining skip conditions.
The left-hand side of each formula should be a condition based on input
values, and the right-hand side should be the ID of the page to skip to if
the condition is met.}
}
\value{
A list of parsed conditions, where each element contains the
condition and the target page ID.
}
\description{
This function is deprecated. Please use \code{sd_skip_forward()} instead.

This function is used to define conditions under which certain pages in the
survey should be skipped. It now behaves like \code{sd_skip_forward()} where only forward
skipping is allowed to prevent navigation loops.
